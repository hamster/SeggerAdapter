# SeggerAdapter

Adapter for Segger and TagConnect

Looking for a cheap way to adapt your Segger to a [Tag-Connect TC2050](http://www.tag-connect.com/TC2050-IDC-NL)?

This board will allow you to adapt:

* 10 pin ARM SWD to
* 20 pin Segger to
* 10 pin TC2050 to

Additionally, the board has two LEDs - one for supply power, another for Vtarget, so you always know if the board under test is powered or not
